# Connecting Glass
    Connect the textures of adjacent glass blocks.
    
    In effect there will only be a border around an entire cluster of glass.
    
    Improved fork of Tr1Ngle's Better Glass.
    
    The mod handles all 4d geometries, painting ridges, edges, and corners. It runs without noticeably slowing down the game.
